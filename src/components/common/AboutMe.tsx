                Hi! My name Is Shehwaz Singh Saini. I was born in india, and came to Canada, Brampton, ON 
                at the age of 4. Initially, my family struggled a lot, we came and left everything
                behind in pursuit of a better life and education. Through sheer hard work and discipline
                my parents were able to break through the poverty line, moving to a newly built house in Windsor, ON. This experience of seeing them
                struggle taught me a lot about how valuable hard work is, and how hard work always beats talent.
            </p>

                Through the years I've discovered 3 passions of mine: cubing, math, and problem solving.
                However, I wasn't initially talented at any of these. It took me hours to solve my first Rubik's Cube
                and even longer to understand math concepts. My problem solving skills were also nowhere near
                what my peers had in the beginning. But, remembering how my parents worked hard to get what they had,
                I knew what I had to do. Work hard.
            </p>

                This persistence led me to tackle Harvard's CS50x course, spending countless hours debugging code 
                and wrestling with algorithms. Completing CS50x wasn't just about learning programmingâ€”it opened doors 
                I never imagined. The problem-solving skills I developed allowed me the opportunity to compete nationally in WRO robotics with a friend, 
                placing 2nd in Canada. Now I'm advancing in competitive programming and building my own projects, 
                proving once again that consistent effort beats raw talent every time.
